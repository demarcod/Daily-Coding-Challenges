# Daily-Coding-Challenges

Trying to keep my skills sharp by doing a coding challenge a day.

As of now, I'm mainly getting these questions from daily coding subscriptions (i.e. [Daily Coding Problem](https://www.dailycodingproblem.com/) & [Daily Byte](https://thedailybyte.dev/)), but am hoping to come up with my own questions as I get more familiar with solving complex algorithm problems.

Categorized by Easy, Medium and Hard, all my solutions are coded in C++ (using version 17).

*Made my own github repo for this because I think it's important to get more practice with thinking of possible test/edge cases yourself instead of relying solely on given testing from leetcode/hackerrank/etc.
